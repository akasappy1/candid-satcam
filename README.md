# candid-satcam
Geocodes a user-input address and then checks whether that address is in the day's descending landsat swath and what kind of weather it's experiencing. If yes and cloud cover &lt; 40% prints a "smile, you're on satellite camera!" type message (but note that landsat resolution is too coarse for actual human figures to appear in imagery.)
